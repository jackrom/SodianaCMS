<p>The <i>body</i> is the content which is shown in the main part of a web-page.</p>
<p>The toolbar is used to format the text and for inserting links to files, pages, and images.</p>
<p>Please do not paste directly from Word. Instead, use the "Paste as Plain Text" icon (clipboard with a blue notebook on it) to remove the hidden codes that are inserted by Word. If you ignore this, your page may not work correctly in Internet Explorer.</p>
