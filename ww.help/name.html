<p>The <i>name</i> field is used to create the page address. For example, if your site is http://example.com/ and you enter the Name as "Contact", then the page address is <b>http://example.com/Contact</b>.</p>
<p>If spaces or other non-alphanumeric characters are entered, they will be replaced by hyphens when used for the address. Example; if the page is "What's This?", then the address would be <b>http://example.com/what-s-this-</b>.</p>
