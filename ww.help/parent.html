<p>The <i>parent</i> is the page under which the current page is situated.</p>
<p>Example: if the current page's name is <i>Accounts</i>, and you want the address to be <i>/Contact/Accounts</i>, then you should set <i>/Contact</i> as the parent.</p>
<p>If a page is to be "top-level" (eg: <i>/Contact-Us</i>) then set the parent to <i>--&nbsp;none&nbsp;--</i>.</p>
