<p>The page <i>type</i> controls what type of page is shown on the front-end of the site.</p>
<p>By default, the page type is <i>normal</i>, which consists of simply the body text.</p>
<p>By changing the page type, you can add different abilities to pages, such as converting the page into an image gallery, or a contact form.</p>
<p>Extra page types can be added by enabling plugins (<i>Site Options &gt; Plugins</i>).</p>
